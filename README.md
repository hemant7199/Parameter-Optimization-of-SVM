# Overview

This report offers a comprehensive analysis of the [Dry Bean Dataset](UCI ML Repository ID: 602).

# Methodology

Data Loading: The Dry Bean Dataset is loaded using the UCI ML Repository API.

Data Preprocessing: The dataset is split into features (X) and target (y). A train-test split is performed for model evaluation.

Model Selection: A Nu-Support Vector Classifier (NuSVC) with Bayesian Optimization is employed to optimize hyperparameters.

Model Evaluation: The model's accuracy is evaluated using cross-validation and convergence plots.

Result Analysis: The best hyperparameters and accuracy obtained are analyzed.
